        Those that will come to my site will be future employers interested in seeing my online portfolio containing projects I have completed. It will answer the question of what sort of skill and creativity I have in various programming languages - which are currently limited to HTML, CSS, and Python - and where I plan to grow those languages in the future through continuing education. JavaScript is a language I have no knowledge of experience using that will be valuable as a web developer, but a class in the future will help me learn to put this language to use. My current certificate will prepare me to work as a front-end developer, with future certificates preparing me to also work as a back-end developer. This will give me the necessary resources to enter the career field as a junior web development intern, with the hopes of someday becoming a senior full-stack web developer.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        The site will also contain an introduction about myself, and where I come from. I was born in 1994 and grew up moving to different states quite a bit due to my father's love for flipping homes. After college, I was a medical assistant for several years before switching my career to become a web developer. I do not regret the time I spent in the medical field, as I will be using the experiences that I gained to further my career in web development. If the opportunities arise, I would love to work for an online medical electronic records company to help create more efficient and user-friendly experiences for workers in the medical field. Many healthcare professionals are from older generations that do not understand technology to the extent that the developers do. Having worked with those older generations, I plan to bring their perspectives to my future developer coworkers so that their concerns can be heard. 
        A summary of my resume will also be available on my site. This will include my first bachelor's degree in biology earned through BYU-Idaho in 2018, along with the several years of work experience as a medical assistant working with and troubleshooting electronic medical records systems. I did not go into the position as lead medical assistant at Boise Dermatology with the intent to troubleshoot the technology in the office; however, the role of troubleshooting found me. It was there that I realized my passion for technology and the passion I once had to pursue technology as my lifelong career. From there, I started my journey through BYU Pathways and BYU-Idaho to earn my second bachelor's degree in software development with an emphasis in web development.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        These two links were guided projects completed during my education through BYU Pathways. The first is an example of a web page with an image of BYU-Idaho campus and an inspirational quote. It was here that I began understanding the capacity that HTML and CSS could do while working together. 
        The second project is a website for an imaginary white water rafting company called Dry Oar. Here is where I began to understand how wireframes are used to guide the construction of a webpage. I chose the color scheme based on the colors used in the company logo in order to create consistency across the website. The fonts were pulled in from Google fonts, since this was a school project that did not require the student to purchase fonts. I tried to use headline fonts that were easy to read and showed a bit of character and adventure. The paragraph fonts were more polished with the effort to keep them easy to read while still contrasting from the easy-going feeling of the headline fonts.
